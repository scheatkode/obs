Do you ever find yourself thinking, "I wish there was a way to automate this
tedious task of keeping track of upstream releases for my custom-built
packages, but I'm just too darn lazy to do it myself"? Well, my friend, you're
in luck!

Introducing the laziest way to keep track of upstream releases for your
custom-built packages! This repository is the result of my own laziness and
desire to avoid the mind-numbing task of manually checking for updates every
time a new release comes out.

With this, all you need to do is sit back, relax, and let the automation do
the work for you. Whenever a new release is detected upstream, you'll be
notified via your package manager of choice (or carrier pigeon, if that's more
your style). Simply upgrade your packages, and voila!

That's right, you can now be lazy AND up-to-date all at the same time. Who
says you can't have your cake and eat it too?

So what are you waiting for? Embrace your laziness and give this repository
a try. Your future self will thank you (and so will your inner sloth).
